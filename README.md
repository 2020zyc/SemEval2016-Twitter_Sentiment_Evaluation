# SemEval2016-Twitter_Sentiment_Evaluation
The code used for my SemEval 2016 submission. 

# Contents
The repository 
describes my participation as team "TwiSE" in the SemEval 2016 challenge.
Specifically, we participated in Task 4, namely ``Sentiment Analysis in Twitter'' for which I implemented
sentiment classification systems for subtasks A, B, C and D.


# Performance
The approach yielded satisfactory results in each of the subtasks, and especially in subtasks C and D.
In the official leaderboard the results were ranked
+ 9/35 for Subtask A: Message Polarity Classification (Positive-Neutral-Negative)
+ 8/19 for Subtask B: Tweet classification according to a two-point scale
+ 1/11  for Subtask C: Tweet classification according to a five-point scale, and
+ 2/14 for Subtask D: Tweet quantification according to a two-point scale
